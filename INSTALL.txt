Enable ssh on ESXi (on console: F2, then Troubleshooting Options)

   # copy the tarball, for example:
   scp drivers.tar.gz 10.116.87.213:/vmfs/volumes/datastore1/.

   # ssh into ESXi, for example:
   ssh 10.116.87.213

   # cd to datastore and extract drivers
   cd /vmfs/volumes/datastore1/.
   tar xzvf drivers.tar.gz

The next steps for updating the drivers are performed by the script install.sh
distributed in this directory.  Run it after extracting the drivers above.
This script will iterate over the packaged drivers on ESXi and replace the
contents with the recompiled ones.

The install.sh script performs the following steps:

* Make a temporary directory in /vmfs/volumes/datastore1/ and go to it

  mkdir –p /vmfs/volumes/datastore1/temp
  cd /vmfs/volumes/datastore1/temp

* Search for the locations of the current drivers in /vmfs/volumes

  find /vmfs/volumes/ -name "*.v0*"

* For each driver found

  * Copy the driver into the temporary directory

     cp /vmfs/volumes/<driver directory>/<driver name> .


  * Use vmtar to extract a tar file

     vmtar  -x <driver name> -o <driver name>.tar  
 
  * Create another temporary directory and  Untar the file into that directory

     mkdir driver_temp 
     cd driver_temp
     tar xvf ../<driver name>.tar
 
  * In the extracted output there will be a directory usr/lib/vmware/vmkmod. 
    If there are any files in the directory /vmfs/volumes/datastore1/with the
    same name copy these files over.  If not go to the final clean up step as
    there are no OSS drivers to update.

     cp ../../drivers/<driver name> usr/lib/vmware/vmkmod/

  * Tar the updated directory

     tar cvf .. /<driver name>.tar
 
  * Go up one directory and Vmtar the new tar file

     vmtar -c <driver name>.tar –o <driver name>.new.tar
 
  * Zip up the file new vm tar file

     gzip < <driver name>.new.tar > <driver name>.v00 


  * Copy the driver back to its original location

     cp <driver name>.v00 /vmfs/volumes/<driver directory>/<driver name>


  * Delete everything in this directory

     rm -rf *
