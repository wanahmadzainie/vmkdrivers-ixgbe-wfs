Required system packages:

  grep sed findutils coreutils

These packages are required to be built and installed in their sub-directories,
in this order, as 'root' (see BUILD.txt in each sub-directory):

  glibc-2.3.2-95.44
  binutils-2.17.50.0.15-modcall
  gcc-4.1.2-9

As 'root', build the vmkdrivers-gpl:

1) tar xzf vmkdrivers-gpl.tgz

2) chmod +x build-vmkdrivers.sh && ./build-vmkdrivers.sh
